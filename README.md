# Bedrock Player Manager (proxy edition)

This plugin is an extension for the awesome GeyserMC. Geyser allows basically Bedrock players to join any Minecraft Java server.
This is a special proxy version (bungeecord/waterfall) with limited functionality (no command modules, only Luckperms group changes), which can run directly on the proxy without installation on any Minecraft server.
