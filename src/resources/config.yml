### ofunnys Bedrock Player Manager proxy edition ###
#   More information on: https://ofunny.world/bedrock-player-manager/
#
# Permission module.
# This module will add a defined permission group to a user whenever this user joins via a Bedrock client.
# It will also remove that group again from the given user whenever the same user joins via a Java client.
#
# IMPORTANT: The proxy version of the BedrockPlayerManager only supports Luckperms as permission plugin within a network installation.
# That means, LP has to be installed on the proxy and on each server using the same database (like MySql) and LPs plugin messaging has to be turned on.
# You will find more information on https://luckperms.net/wiki/Network-Installation â€“ Geyser and Floodgate have to be installed on the proxy only.
# (If you need the full range of Bedrock Player Managers functions, you have to install the Bedrock Player Manager in the conventional way on each server.
# You may install the Bedrock Player Manager on the proxy and on every Minecraft server, but make sure to activate the permission module on the proxy ONLY)!
permissions:
  # If true, the following permission group will be added / removed depending on the clients version (Bedrock / Java) when a player joins.
  enabled: true
  # The permission group to add for bedrock users or to remove for java users.
  # If a user joins via Floodgate, the group gets applied otherwise removed (if previously inherited by the joining user).
  # Make sure to add the group in your permission plugin first!
